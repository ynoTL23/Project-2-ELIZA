# Fall 2018 CMP-326 Project 2 - The ELIZA Project
### Tony Lu

#### Overview
The program consists of a series of questions that is asked to the user. The user then responds with their responses. After each session, a log of all the questions and answers will be shown along with a short analysis of the longest and shortest word that they have used during that session. As well as other buttons that display the longest word from each of their answers.

#### How-To
In 1996 there was a program named ELIZA. It parodied a psychotherapist session, such that the user would type sentences and the program used those words to compose a question.
